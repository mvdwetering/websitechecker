# Websitechecker

Custom integration that checks if a website is reachable or not.

A website is considered OK when an HTTP request returned with a response code < 500.
Or the other way around it is considered a problem if the HTTP request failed or returned a response code >= 500.

The sensor offers the following additional attributes:

* url: The configured URL for this sensor
* last_status: Status of last update. Some possible values are "200 - OK" or "Connection error". More error values exist.
* last_error_status: Status of last error, allows to easily see what the last issue was if it came back already.
